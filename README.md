# Past-USACO-Solutions
You can search for most of these by division. If they are the older problems and use file input i titled my solution by the filename given by the problem. If they use standard output i simply titled them the name of the problem.

Most of the solutions will get all test cases correct

The contests folder will be contests I have participated in and are solutions I wrote up during the contest.


They include:
